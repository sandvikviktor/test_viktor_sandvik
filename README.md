## Documentation

The final time to complete this project was 10 hours. The main reason why I needed this time was because I had to learn more about the components included in React Native, and how to use them.

If I had more time, I would have kept working on the details screen to show more information about each season and episodes.
I also would have added a proper drawer menu and a better design in general for the home screen.

I decided to not use any global state management because I didn't need it for this size of project.
But as the project grew with more screens and data, it would be more necessary.
