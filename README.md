## Development information

The final time to complete this project was 11 hours. The main reason why this amount of time was needed is because I usually work with React for web development, so I had to learn more about the components included in React Native while working.

If I had more time, I would have kept working on the details screen to show more information about each season and episode.
I also would have added a proper drawer menu and a better design in general for the home screen.

I decided to not use any global state management because I didn't need it for this size of project.
But in the future if project grew with more screens and data, it would have been more necessary.
